# auto_install
This repository contains my dot files and installation scripts, that I use to set up a clean installation of Ubuntu. This configuration was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Althought it should work on Linux Mint as well.

# Contents
- xorg configuration, mainly hidpi settings
- i3gaps install and configuration
- polybar install and configuration (including fontawesome 5 fonts)
- ranger install and configuration
- emacs editor config, with all the modes I use
- compton installation and configuration
- urxvt terminal installation and configuration

# Setup
To successfully run the installation script you will need to specify two directories directory of the installation and you github repo directory where all the repositories will be downloaded. After that you should be able to run the script.

# Customization
To select what should and should not be installed check out the main function in the install.sh file.

# Warning
This setup works for my system, it might not work for you. If you decide to use it prepare for troubleshooting.
